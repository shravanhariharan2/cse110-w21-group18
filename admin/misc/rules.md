2. Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
  - Primary means of Communication: Slack general group chat
  - Expectations
    - Communicate if you are late to meetings, have issues, need help, or need to miss deadlines by replying in the Slack.
    - Try to same-day-response by at least checking the Slack once a day.
    - Each member speaks (about anything) at least once in the meeting.
    
3. Scheduling Meetings (Schedule at least one meeting as part of constructing your team agreement.)
  - Meet weekly on Sundays @ ~9pm.
  - If an additional meeting is needed, talk about setting up the follow-up meeting on Sunday.
  - Follow an agreed-upon means of scheduling meetings.
  - Set up an agenda before meeting.
  - A day before the meeting, team leaders should push new minutes to the repo and add any discussion points if needed.
  
4. General Responsibilities for All Team Members
  - Come to meetings in a timely manner if possible, otherwise communicate with team on Slack
  - Submit work, code reviews, and assignments on time if possible, otherwise communicate
  - Check Slack at least once a day to reply to other team members for discussions & action items
  - We should try to finish assignments / action items at least 1 day before their deadline

5. Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines (Optional)
  - TBD

6. Conflict Resolution
  - We should vote as a team for any conflicts that arise between two or more parties
  - Team leaders Keshav and Jose reach out to that person and try to figure out why they did not meet the deadline or come to a meeting. If they don’t respond then reach out to a TA.
  
7. Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s
  - If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.

8. Team Signatures
