# CSE 110 Group 18 - Check-in 1

## Brainstorming the Pomodoro
### Attendees: Shravan, Steven, Trinity, Austin, Juan, Jordan
### Details: Zoom @ 9PM PST Thursday 01/28/21

## General Minutes:
* Discussed with Jordan our progress and our work for the next week


## Discussion Points
* What are everyones thoughts on checking off tasks during the Pomodoro routine?
  * We have 3 current workflows:
    1. When a user finishes a task, they stop the Pomodoro timer and take a 5 minute break
    2. When a user finishes a task, they check-off that task on the timer and move on to the next one
    3. When a user finishes a task, they move on to the next one and check-off that task once the break starts
  * We will vote on this during Sunday's meeting 

## Action Items
* Assign individual roles. Jordan recommended:
  * 2 team leads
  * 1 designer
  * 1 architect
  * 1 build engineer
  * 1 test engineer
  * x developers
* Think about roadmap and how long it would take for design phase, development, architecture, testing.
Jordan recommended we add a buffer of 0.5-1 weeks before presentation (week 10 / finals) to finish all development before then
* Figure out a standup schedule (doesn't have to be a meeting, could just be through Slack messages)
