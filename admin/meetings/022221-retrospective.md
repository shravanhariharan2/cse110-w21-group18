# CSE 110 Group 18

## Retrospective
### Attendees: Shravan, Trinity, Shane, Jose, Steven
### Details: Zoom @ 9:30PM PST Monday, 2/22/21

## General Minutes:
* Check-in with Jordan. He recommended that we should
  * Get JSDoc automation setup
  * Start creating ADRs
  * Be more active in standup 

## Discussion Points
* Retrospective
  * What went well
    * Week 1 development pace was very strong. PRs were put up pretty early on, and changes were made fairly quickly
    * Everyone was pretty on top of their tasks when assigned something - The team leads never had to reach out and ask how things were going
    * Group programming is beneficial for touching base with what others are working on as well as improving the overall bus factor of the team. We should do more of that in the future.
    * Group member transparency is pretty good - everyone who wants to say something says that thing and no one really bashes them for it
  * What could've gone better
    * Meeting start times started getting later and later during the weeks. We should all aim to be in the meeting before 9:00pm (ideally at least 1 minute before), or message the Slack if we're going to be late.
    * More people should try to attend every meeting - it has been somewhat rare for all of us to be there at the same time. We should try to increase communication when we need to miss meetings. The current meeting schedule is at least 1 meeting on Sunday 9pm and 1 meeting on Monday 9pm. Everyone should be there for both - other meetings may be planned as seen necessary
    * Standup participation should be more consistent daily - ideally everyone replies every day before 11:59PM what they've done, what they will do, and any blockages they're dealing with
    * Harder-ish deadlines should be assigned for when tasks should be ready for review in PR. Our new "deadline" is Thursday night of that week. 
  * Any other general comments
    * Development pace - it feels like we are behind since the 2nd half of the sprint was slower than the first, but that's just because a) there were a bunch of other things going on that week w/ other classes and b) the tasks assigned that week were larger than the first week
    * Overall team satisfaction - everyone is happy with the current progress and with each other's performance and overall morale is very solid
