# CSE 110 Group 18

## Design Planning and Sprint 2.5 Task Delegation
### Attendees: 
### Details: Zoom @ 10PM PST Sunday 3/7

## General Minutes:
* 

## Discussion Points
* Should we change our design?
* Feedback from Jordan:
  * UI:
    * We aren't really optimizing white space very well in our app right now, since we have to scroll down a bit to view tasks, plus the side margins are pretty empty.
      * Potential fixes:
        * Put the timer and task list adjacent to each other
        * Remove some vertical white space between the timer and task list
        * Shrink the vertical size of the timer and task items
        * Anything else?
    * The green with "Add Task" doesn't really vibe with the green used in other sections
    * Make sure the UI is user-centric, i.e. it makes it as easy as possible for the user to navigate through the app (this was more just general comments, he didn't specify if our app followed that or not)
    * Make sure the UI follows pomodoro philosophies and isn't just another timer. He mentioned most groups are doing things like minimizing the timer/adding animations to make the app feel calmer
    * One thing he'd like to see that no other team has done: minimizing the seconds (which we discussed yesterday!!!). One thing we can do is make the seconds much smaller between minutes 1-25, and below 1 minute, expand the seconds to normal size
* Task delegation
  * TODOs:
    * Settings modal
    * Settings unit + integration tests
    * Pomodoro counting
    * Distraction markers
    * Metrics modal
    * Info modal
