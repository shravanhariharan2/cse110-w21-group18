# CSE 110 Group 18

## Check-in Meeting
### Attendees: Shravan, Jordan
### Details: Zoom @ 10AM PST Tuesday 3/2

## General Minutes:
* Demoed:
  * Task list functionality
  * Notifications functionality
  * JSDoc automation
  * ADRs
  * Timer/session unit tests
  * Plans for this week
* Feedback from Jordan:
  * UI:
    * We aren't really optimizing white space very well in our app right now, since we have to scroll down a bit to view tasks, plus the side margins are pretty empty.
      * Potential fixes:
        * Put the timer and task list adjacent to each other
        * Remove some vertical white space between the timer and task list
        * Shrink the vertical size of the timer and task items
    * The green with "Add Task" doesn't really vibe with the green used in other sections
    * Make sure the UI is user-centric, i.e. it makes it as easy as possible for the user to navigate through the app (this was more just general comments, he didn't specify if our app followed that or not)
    * Make sure the UI follows pomodoro philosophies and isn't just another timer. He mentioned most groups are doing things like minimizing the timer/adding animations to make the app feel calmer
    * One thing he'd like to see that no other team has done: minimizing the seconds (which we discussed yesterday!!!). One thing we can do is make the seconds much smaller between minutes 1-25, and below 1 minute, expand the seconds to normal size
  * More people should participate in PR discussion/code reviews. He'd like to see more discussion happening there, so people should try to get their eyes on more PRs and leave more comments/reviews
  * We're pretty on-par with other teams currently in terms of progress
  * Note: Jordan said none of these issues are too huge, they're just things to keep in mind as we keep developing


## Discussion Points
* Discussed the above comments

## Action Items
* More people should be looking at PRs. Those who put up PRs should request a review from everyone on the team (though not everyone needs to actually review it)
* Discuss potential changes to the UI
* If people can come to discussion @ 9AM tomorrow, that would be really helpful as to see what other teams' apps look like / understanding what looks good and what doesn't
