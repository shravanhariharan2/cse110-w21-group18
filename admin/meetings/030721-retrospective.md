# CSE 110 Group 18

## Sprint 2 Retrospective
### Attendees: Steven, Juan, Trinity, Shane, Shravan, Austin
### Details: Zoom @ 9PM PST Monday 3/7

## General Minutes:
* Held discussion

## Discussion Points
* What went well?
  * Standup participation was slightly better. We had a higher average amount of respondees to daily standup than last sprint, and pretty much anyone who was working on something responded
  * Development implementation was really strong this sprint, and we pumped out lots of crucial features (task list, task selection, notifications, basically our entire test suite, ADRs, builds)
  * Task delegation / execution was also strong, everyone worked on what they were assigned pretty extensively
  * Code reviews and communication within the PR was pretty good - people got their eyes on the code at a quick rate which allowed iterating to happen much faster
  * Did more group programming sessions - feedback was generally positive since group programming allowed us to:
    * Ask questions to each other
    * Resolve issues collaboratively
    * Gain awareness of what others are working on
  * Meeting start times definitely improved from last sprint
* What could've gone better?
  * Standup participation was still not super good, ideally everyone responds every day but it's fine if not everyone responds every single day
  * Communication between teammates during implementation stage could've been better. It got to the point where we didn't know if someone was working on something or not and multiple people were working on the same feature
  * Hard + soft deadlines should be enforced more (it's on the team lead to set those) - allows team to pace themselves easier and to know what they have to work on at a given time
* Any general comments?
  * Standup ping time (3PM every day) is still fine since it allows people to come back to it and write what they did
  * Seems like a lot of the administrative work is put on the team leads but in reality it isn't that much work :^)
  * PRs weren't put up as early as they were last sprint but that might be because the feature sizes were much larger this sprint than last sprint
